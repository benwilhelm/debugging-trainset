# Debugging Trains!

This project accompanies the workshops for my course on [debugging web applications](https://ben-wilhelm.teachable.com/p/debugging-strategies-and-tactics1). It is a React/Redux application that assumes basic proficiency with both technologies. It was bootstrapped with create-react-app. If you're curious about it, I've included CRA's boilerplate README [below](#create-react-app-boilerplate)

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/benwilhelm/debugging-trainset.git
cd debugging-trainset
```

### Installing Dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Starting the App
```
npm start
```

This should open http://localhost:3000 automatically. If it doesn't, you can do so manually

## Branches

Below is a listing of the relevant branches that you will use as you progress through the workshops. It's a good idea to run `npm install` any time you switch branches to make sure you have all the appropriate dependencies installed.

### Master branch

This is the full, working version of the application. It is (as far as I know) bug free, and exists for you to reference if you have questions about the expected behavior of the app.

### Workshop Branches

Each workshop has a branch for its starting point as well as its solution.

| Exercise                   | starting point | solution       |
|:---------------------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| 1) Failure to Insert Tiles | `ws1-start`    | `ws1-solution` |
| 2) Tiles Won't Rotate      | `ws2-start`    | `ws2-solution` |
| 3) Track Won't Switch      | `ws3-start`    | `ws3-solution` |
| 4) An Intermittent Defect  | `ws4-start`    | `ws4-solution` |


### Viewing Solutions as Diffs

To view the solution to a particular workshop as a diff, you can run `npm run solution:ws#`, where # is the number of the workshop. For instance: `npm run solution:ws1`

# Create-React-App Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The text below was generated by CRA, and you don't need to know any of it to do the course exercises.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
